<blockquote>
  <p>[One] way to overcome our obsession with winning the admiration of other people is to go out of our way to do things likely to trigger their disdain. . . .Cato made a point of ignoring the dictates of fashion. . .According to Plutarch, Cato did this not because he “sought vainglory”; to the contrary , he dressed differently in order to accustom himself “to be ashamed only of what was really shameful, and to ignore men’s low opinion of other things.” In other words, Cato consciously did things to trigger the disdain of other people simply so he could practice ignoring their disdain.”</p>
