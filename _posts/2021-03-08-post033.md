> The Universe, she's dancing now  
They got her lit up, lit up on the moon  
They got stars doing cartwheels, all the nebulas on the tune  
...  
>The Universe, she's wounded  
But she's still got infinity ahead of her  
She's still got you and me

**reflections**

I step out of the house. It's around 5 in the morning.Most of the city is still asleep and the world is silent.I look up at the sky lit up with stars. I spot the familiar ones. I draw imaginary lines between them. I make a star out of stars.I think about how I could do this recursively forever.I think about the majesty of universe.I think about how my great great grandmother and her great great grandmother could have been watching the same stars and wondering the same things as I am doing today.I think about how time is infinite. To be alive, to think what I am thinking, to be a witness to the wonder that is the universe,to feel one with time and space.There is something so deeply moving about this experience and I find myself in tears.All at once, my brain is completely flooded with words I have read over the years, music I have listened to over the years, works of art I have seen over the years.

Words from

[Carl Sagan's famous Pale Blue Dot](https://www.planetary.org/worlds/pale-blue-dot)

>>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

Alan Lightman's book [Searching For Stars on an Island in Maine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35749415-searching-for-stars-on-an-island-in-maine)

>>On this island, I am light years away from the noise and heave of the world. Like Thoreau, I came here “because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what life had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived." I choose to live.

Rebecca Elson's poem [Antitode to fear of death](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/mar/23/poem-of-the-week-antidotes-to-fear-of-death-by-rebecca-elson)  

>>No outer space, just space,  
 The light of all the not yet stars  
 Drifting like a bright mist,  
 And all of us, and everything  
 Already there  
 But unconstrained by form.

[Anna Leahy's  poem The habit of light](https://vimeo.com/262836574) inspired by the work of Henrietta Leavitt

>>The universe is made of distance and of dust.  
 More dust than star out there

[Feynman's lament](http://www.feynman.com/stories/poem-for-rpf/) about poets who refuse to mix science and poetry,

>>What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?

[Van Gogh's Starry Night](https://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/starry-night.html)

River in ['To The Moon'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/To_the_Moon/) (the incredibly beautiful,cathartic RPG)

>> I’ve never told anyone, but… I’ve always thought they were lighthouses. Billions of lighthouses… … stuck at the far end of the sky...They can see all the other lighthouses out there, and they want to talk to them.  But they can’t, because they’re all too far apart to hear what the others are saying.  All they can do… is shine their lights from afar.  … So that’s what they do.  They shine their lights at the other lighthouses, and at me....Because one day… … I’m going to befriend one of them.


In the background I am listening in my mind to [Nils Frahm's Says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIwwjy4slI8) and  [Arrival of the Birds by The Cinematic Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9gFLkNdHvA).

So many words, so many snapshots, so many notes ..all floating by.


Those feelings I felt the previous day, the one before that, all the yesterdays, of hurt , bitterness ,envy, resentment, perceived injustices,the physical and mental fatigue that comes with daily drudgery of life has all but melted away.The sense of despair lifts and I feel free in a way I haven't felt in years.

None of this matters.Nothing matters.I am grateful.I am grateful that I even get to be a part of all of this.To be human,to think these thoughts, to be awed and moved by nature,by the universe,by the brilliance of men and women who write so eloquently,who compose music that transcends space and time, who create works of art that is timeless, who build skyscrapers, railroads, reactors, rovers travelling millions of miles landing on another planet ,sending back pictures and videos ..... How can you not be moved.

For now, this is all I can afford.The duties of the day ahead beckon me.As I soak the experience in,I have one of those rare epiphanies.We all have our struggles.We are all alone,together.To be empathetic without having my cup full is challenging.I am human.I have my desires.I have my flaws.I have my failures.I am not a monk.But I can reflect and forgive myself, make room for mistakes, give myself some air to breathe.

Later in the night ,I write all of this down , reflect some more in the quiet of the night.Life lessons, if you will.Some clichéd, yes ,but reinforcements help.

+ Be more forgiving of others.  
+ Do not let words and actions of others bother you,they don't matter and they only hurt if you want to be hurt.  
+ Make ENOUGH time and space for yourself because no one else is going to do it for you. And if you don't ,you will wither away and be taken for granted.
+ It is possible and essential to carve out a space you can retreat yourself to, when you feel overwhelmed.It is NOT SELFISH to do this.(The idea of putting on the your oxygen mask first)
+ Once you have filled your cup,only then lend your hand and ears but keep the spoken words limited.
+ There is clarity in the written word - pen on paper is therapeutic.One tends to be carried away by the moment with spoken words.
+ Some people are impossible to please and you will always fall short - that's not your problem.
+ You will be old one day too.Be the kind of person your older self would want to interact with.
+ Empathy, not pity
+ Get back your sense of humour in life
  >>Humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds ... Viktor Frankl  

+ Be [self reliant](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16643/16643-h/16643-h.htm#SELF-RELIANCE) but remember that seeking help when you lack clarity or knowledge is not a failure on your part.
+ When conflicted, seek multiple perspectives by reading up and listening to those whom you look up to or respect, but eventually own up to the decisions you make, good or bad.
+ It is the trials and tribulations that bring clarity in life.As much they drain your mental and physical energy,making even the smallest of tasks seem like an ordeal, it is these adversities that will teach you the essence of life and what you truly hold dear.  
+ Neither do you have to live upto the expectations of others, nor should you expect others to live upto yours.
+ A part of 'adulting' is to come to terms with not being understood.
+ Yes,most people are kind and good willed but they aren't going to get you and that's okay.
+ Go All In.
  >>If you’re going to live life, you’ve got to be all in.
  >>Marian Diamond

+ And if everything fails, you have at least tried and there is always music,coding,art,books,teaching and long walks !

There isn't much one needs in order to be at peace with oneself.
I am enough.I am okay.With all due apologies to Beckett, I can go on, I will go on.


If I feel differently and contradict myself in future, I call upon Walt Whitman in my defence


>>Do I contradict myself?  
Very well then I contradict myself,  
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
