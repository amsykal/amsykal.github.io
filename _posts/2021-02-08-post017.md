What we call chaos is just patterns we haven't recognized.What we call random is just patterns we can't decipher. what we can't understand we call nonsense. What we can't read we call gibberish.

```
// grid
// every cell has horizontal noisy lines
// diagonal lines in background color drawn
// effect - broken scribbles
// noise level, cell size changed for variations

let s;
let simplexNoise;
let seed;

function setup(){
  createCanvas(600,600);
  background(23, 28, 51);
  // palette
  // create noise object
  simplexNoise = new OpenSimplexNoise(Date.now());
  // cell size
  s = 200;
  // seed to be incremented for every cell
  seed = 0;
}

function draw(){
  noLoop();
  makegrid();

function makegrid(){
  let rows = height/s;
  let cols = width/s;
  // make a grid of cells
  // g is gap between lines within a cell
  let g = 10;

      let x = j*s;
      let y = i*s;
      push();
      translate(x,y);
      // in each cell draw horizontal noisy lines
      // changing the gap between the lines, the noise input etc
      // gives variations
      render(g);
      pop();
    }
    // the gap between 2 lines within a cell
    // we increment this gap by 2 for every row
    // so as we go down the rows there is more space
     g += 2;
  }

  // set color, style etc
  let fl = color(238, 240, 242);
  fl.setAlpha(255);
  stroke(fl);
  noFill();
  strokeWeight(2);

  // margin to be left for each cell on all sides
  let m = 12;

  // change seed for every cell to get different patterns
  seed += 1000
  // drawing the lines
  for(let i = m; i <= s-m; i+=g){
    //let t = millis()/1000;
    beginShape();

This series presents noisy lines in a grid.

The method used is very similar to the one used in [this previous series implementing noisy lines in a grid](https://amsykal.github.io/art with code/2021/01/03/post008.html)

To give the appearance of scribbles , the code introduces breaks between the horizontal lines by drawing spaced diagonal lines as below.

```
//diagonal lines to insert breaks in each horizontal line
for(let i = m; i <= s-m; i+= 2*g){
  strokeWeight(2);
  stroke(23, 28, 51);
  line(0,i,i,0);
  line(s-m,i,i,s-m);
}
```
