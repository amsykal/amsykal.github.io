#### PROBLEM

[Problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=148)

Explore divisibility patterns in  Pascal's Triangle and find the total number of entries in n rows that are not divisible by a prime p.

--------
**Pascal's Triangle**

Given the row number n, we can compute the entries in the row of Pascal's triangle as

$$\binom{n}{0},\binom{n}{1},\binom{n}{2},...\binom{n}{n} $$

---
**Sierpiński Triangle**

Now let's take the entries in the Pascal's triangle and replace them with mod 2 values.The figure below shows the first 8 rows of the mod 2 version on left and original version on the right

<img src = "/images/e002.png" width = "350" height = "250"/>

A close look at the mod 2 triangle reveals a Sierpinski Fractal.

Here is one way to build the Sierpinski mod 2 triangle without using the Pascal's triangle.

We take the first triangle of 2 rows and make 2 copies of it below, one on left and one on the right. There is one gap left which we fill with 0. Repeat this procedure again by taking the triangle which now contains 4 rows , make a copy on left and right and fill the gaps with zeroes. We now have a triangle of 8 rows. Proceeding this way we get a Sierpiński triangle.

<img src = "/images/e003.png" width = "350" height = "250"/>

As we can see , number of rows follows the geometric progression of 2, 4, 8 etc.

How do we know that this in fact is the Pascal's mod 2 triangle ? In other words how do we know repeating the top triangle , in the left and right, and filling the gaps (the middle triangle) with zeroes gives us the mod 2 triangle ?

**Lucas Theorem**

The argument to prove that this indeed is the case, uses Lucas theorem.

A brief detour to take a look at [Lucas's theorem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/lucas-theorem/)

For non-negative integers m and n and a prime p

$\binom{m}{n} ≡\prod_{i=0}^{k}\binom{m_i}{n_i}(mod \; \;p)$

Where,

$m = m_{k}m_{k-1}...m_2m_1m_0$
$n = n_{k}n_{k-1}...n_2n_1n_0$

are base p representations of m and n

Consider an example with m = 5 , n = 2, p = 2.

$5_{10} = 101_2$

$2_{10} = 010_2$

$\binom{5}{2} ≡\prod_{i=0}^{3}\binom{m_i}{n_i}(mod \; \;2)$

$\binom{5}{2} ≡\binom{1}{0}\binom{0}{1}\binom{1}{0}(mod \; \;2) = 0(mod \; \;2)$

Note that $\binom{r}{c} = 0$ when r < c

We can verify this is true since $\binom{5}{2} = 10 ≡ 0 (mod \; \;2)$

Consider yet another example with m = 7, n = 3 and p = 2.

$7_{10} = 111_2$

$3_{10} = 011_2$

$\binom{7}{3} ≡\prod_{i=0}^{3}\binom{m_i}{n_i}(mod \; \;2)$

$\binom{7}{3} ≡\binom{1}{0}\binom{1}{1}\binom{0}{0}(mod \; \;2) = 1(mod \; \;2)$

Again we can verify $\binom{7}{3} = 35 ≡ 1 (mod \; \;2)$

Back to the original question of why the mod 2 Pascal triangle ends up in a Sierpinski triangle.

Following is the outline of one proof as laid out [here](http://larryriddle.agnesscott.org/ifs/siertri/Pascalmath.htm)

Say $P_n$ is the nth triangle.  $P_n$ has $2^n$ rows.

For a given row r, the entries of the original Pascal triangle (without taking mod 2) are given by $\binom{r}{0},\binom{r}{1},...\binom{r}{r}$

In general an entry is given by $\binom{r}{c}$ where c = 0,1,...r.

Since the number of rows equals $2^n$, both r and c are less than $2^n$. Note that counting of rows starts at 0.

So for n = 0 , $P_0 = 2^0 = 1$ row.

For n = 1, $P_1 = 2^1 = 2$ rows.

For n = 2, $P_2 = 2^2 = 4$ rows.

etc

Representing r and c in base 2 we have,

$r = r_{n-1}r_{n-2}...r_2r_1r_0$

$c = c_{n-1}c_{n-2}...c_2c_1c_0$

Note that the last row of every  $P_n$  (mod 2 version of the triangle) has $2^n$ entries all of which are 1.

For instance the last row of $P_3$ has 8 entries and is 11111111.

Now consider an entry in r,c (row number r and column number c ) in the triangle $P_n$. The corresponding entry in lower left triangle for $P_{n+1}$ is given by $2^n+r, c$ and the lower right triangle is given by $2^n+r,2^n+c$. This is easy to see as the last row of $P_n$ contains $2^n$ entries.

Example: Consider $P_2$ with r = 2 and c = 0.The corresponding lower triangle entry for $P_3$ is $r = 2^2 + 2, c = 0$ i.e 6,0.

More general representation as clearly illustrated in  [this page](http://larryriddle.agnesscott.org/ifs/siertri/Pascalmath.htm)


<img src = "/images/e005.png" width = "400" height = "300"/>


The aim now is to show that the entries in lower left and lower right triangles of $P_{n+1}$ are equivalent to the entry in $P_n$

Consider the left triangle entry $2^n+r, c$ in $P_{n+1}$

We can write $2^n + r$  as $1r_{n-1}r_{n-2}...r_2r_1r_0$ in base 2

Where r = $r_{n-1}r_{n-2}...r_2r_1r_0$

From Lucas's theorem ,

$\binom{2^n + r}{c}(mod \; \;2) = \binom{1r_{n-1}r_{n-2}...r_2r_1r_0}
{0c_{n-1}c_{n-2}...c_2c_1c_0}(mod \; \;2) = \binom{1}{0}\binom{r_{n-1}}{c_{n-1}}\binom{r_{n-2}}{c_{n-2}}...\binom{r_{0}}{c_{0}}(mod \; \;2) = \binom{r_{n-1}}{c_{n-1}}\binom{r_{n-2}}{c_{n-2}}...\binom{r_{0}}{c_{0}}(mod \; \;2 = \binom{r}{c}(mod \; \;2)$

Consider the right triangle entry $2^n+r, 2^n + c$ in $P_{n+1}$

$\binom{2^n+r}{2^n+c}(mod \; \;2) = \binom{1r_{n-1}r_{n-2}...r_2r_1r_0}
{1c_{n-1}c_{n-2}...c_2c_1c_0}(mod \; \;2) = \binom{1}{1}\binom{r_{n-1}}{c_{n-1}}\binom{r_{n-2}}{c_{n-2}}...\binom{r_{0}}{c_{0}}(mod \; \;2) = \binom{r_{n-1}}{c_{n-1}}\binom{r_{n-2}}{c_{n-2}}...\binom{r_{0}}{c_{0}}(mod \; \;2 = \binom{r}{c}(mod \; \;2)$

We are now left with the middle triangle entries and need to show that these are all 0.

Consider row 8.
Going from column 1 to column 7 , the original elements in the pascal triangle are given by

$\binom{8}{1},  \binom{8}{2},...\binom{8}{7}$

Recall

$\binom{r}{c} = \binom{r-1}{c} + \binom{r-1}{c-1}$

i.e each element in current row and column is the sum of adjacent numbers in previous row
As we can see in the case of all numbers in row 8, from column 1 to column 7, the adjacent numbers in previous row are all 1 mod 2 .

Adding two 1 mod 2 numbers gives us 0 mod 2. So the 7 entries in row 8 are mod 0.

Proceeding to row 9, we will have six 0 mod 2 numbers from col 2 to col 7. (0 mod 2 + 0 mod 2 = 0 mod 2)

If we go on this way , we will eventually reach row 14 with just one 0 mod 2 number in column 7.

Note that the next row is row 15. This is $2^4-1$ i.e the last row of $P_4$ and all entries are 1 mod 2.

---

All of the above can be repeated for a mod 3 triangle. The pattern will repeat every $3^n$ rows.

Below are first 27 rows of mod 3 triangle.

As we can observe the pattern is repeated after 3 rows and again after 9 rows.

Notice in particular row 8 and row 26. We see that these rows have alternating 1s and 2s. Also the row that immediately follow i.e row 9 and 27 have 1s at the extremes and all 0s between. This is exactly similar to how the mod 2 triangle works. We can construct mod 5 or mod 7 triangles and see that they all result in the familiar Sierpiński Triangle.

**Python Snippet Used to Generate the Image Above**

```
# n = number of rows
# p - which mod p ?

n, p = 82, 3
r = [[0]*n for i in range(n)]
r[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1,n):
   r[i][0] = 1
   r[i][n-1] = 0
   for j in range(1,i):
       r[i][j] = (r[i-1][j-1]+r[i-1][j])%p
   rs = [str(k)+'|' for k in r[i]]
   rs = ''.join(rs[:i])
   print(' '*(n-i) + '|' + rs)
```

Coming now to the question of how many digits in one row of Pascal's triangle is not divisible by some prime p

As we know from Lucas theorem is $\binom{r}{c}$ is divisible by p iff at least one of the base-p digits of c is greater than the corresponding base-p digit of r.  Equivalently $\binom{r}{c}$ is not divisible by p if all of the digits in c is less than or equal to corresponding digit in r.

Consider row 5 of the mod 2 triangle i.e r = 5, p = 2

$(5)_{10} = (101)_2$

c can take on the values from 0 to 5

In base 2 , the numbers 0 to 5 are

000 001 010 011 100 101

As we can see only 010 and 011 have a digit greater than corresponding digit in 101.
And the remaining 4 have all digits less than or equal to corresponding digit in 101.

We can compute this as follows,
Looking at r = 101, the number of ways in which each digit of c can be lesser than or equal to corresponding digit in r is given as below

r|1|0|1|
:--|:--|:-|:-
number of ways|2|1|2

So total number of c we can build such that each digit of c can be lesser than or equal to corresponding digit in r is 2x1x2 = 4

Consider another example, this time considering a mod 3 triangle.

r = 21

$21_{10} = 210_3$

r|2|1|0|
:--|:--|:-|:-
number of ways|3|2|1

When $r_i = 2$ the corresponding $c_i$ can be 0,1,2 and therefore 3 ways.

This gives a total of 3x2x1 = 6 entries in row 21 which are not divisible by 3. This is indeed the case by looking at mod 3 triangle.

A mod 7 example

r = 41

$41_{10} = 56_7$

r|5|6|
:--|:--|:-|
number of ways|6|7|

This gives a total of 6x7 = 42 entries in row 41 which are not divisible by 7. This can be verified by looking at mod 7 triangle below.

<img src = "/images/e007.png"/>

In fact row 41 has 42 entries none of which are divisible by 7.

**Tying It All Up**

At this point we know

1. How to compute total number of entries in a row r that are not divisible by p.

2. mod p triangles are Sierpiński triangles and so are recursive in nature.

We can use these 2 facts to solve Problem 148 which asks us to compute the number of entries which are not divisible by 7 in the first one billion (109) rows of Pascal's triangle.

Looking at a few examples.

p = 3,

Listing down the first 27 rows in base 3 we have

0
1
2
10
11
12
20
21
22
100
101
102
110
111
120
121
122
200
201
202
210
211
212
220
221
222

For each row we know we can compute the total number of entries not divisible by 3.

If we do this for first 3 rows we get

r|number of ways|
:--|:--|
0|1
1|2
2|3

Summing up these entries (for first 3 rows) we have

$1+2+3 = 3\times4/2 = 6$

Moving on to the next rows from 4 to 9

r|number of ways|
:--|:--|
10|2x1
11|2x2
12|2x3
20|3x1
21|3x2
22|3x3

Summing up these entries (for the first 9 rows) we have

$1\times(1+2+3) + 2\times(1+2+3) + 3\times(1+2+3)$
$= (1+2+3)\times(1+2+3) = (3\times4/2)\times(3\times4/2)$
$=6\times6= 36$

Moving on further from row 10 to 27 , we can see the pattern and conclude we will have

$1\times36 + 2\times36 + 3\times36$
$=(1+2+3)\times36$
$=6\times36$
$=216$

At this point we have

rows|no of entries not divisible by 3
:--|:--|
3|6
9|36
27|216

To generalise given $3^k$ rows, we have $T(3)^k$ entries.

Where T(3) is the triangular number given by 3(3+1)/2

As presented [here](https://kuanwh.com/pascal-divisibility) ,

Let G(n) = number of entries not divisible by p for first n rows
g(n) = number of entries not divisible by p for nth row

For any prime p

$G(p^i - 1) = (T(p))^i$

We can also conclude

$G(a_ip^i−1) = T(a_i)\times(T(p))^i$

Since $a_ip^i−1 = a_i000...0 - 1$

For a more general case, we then have the following recursive function

n = $a_ia_{i-1}...a_2a_1a_0$

$G(a_ia_{i-1}...a_2a_1a_0)$

$= G(a_i000...0-1) + g(a_i000...0)+g(a_ia_{i-1}...0)+...g(a_ia_{i-1}...a_2a_1a_0)$

$= T(a_i)\times(T(p))^i + (a_i+1)G(a_{i-1}000...0-1)$


Consider n = 25 and p = 3 to illustrate how this works

$25_{10} = 221_3$

Writing all numbers in base 3

$G(221) = G(200-1) + g(200)+g(201)+g(202)+...g(221)$

$G(200-1) = T(2)\times T(3)^2 = 3\times36 = 108$

$g(200)+g(201)+g(202)+...g(221)$

$=(2+1)\times G(21)$

$G(21) = G(20-1) + g(20) + g(21)$

$G(20-1) = T(2)\times T(3)^1 = 3\times6 = 18$

$g(20) + g(21)$

$=(2+1)\times G(1) = 3$

Plugging in all the values

$G(221) = 108 + 3\times (18 + 3) = 171$

So for n = 25, there are 171 numbers which are not divisible by 3 in the Pascal's triangle.

The general code in Python

```
# convert n to number in base b
def baseconvert(n,b):
   ans = ''
   while n > 0:
       ans += str(n%b)
       n = n//b
   return ans[::-1]

# triangular number
def T(k):
   return k*(k+1)//2

# recursive function G
def G(n):
   if len(n) == 1:
       return T(int(n))

   d = int(n[0])
   return (T(d))*tp**(len(n) - 1) + (d + 1) * G(n[1:])

# an example case with p = 7, n = 100
p = 7
tp = p*(p+1)//2
print(G(baseconvert(100,7)))

```
