This is a series which draws noisy circles over a grid of rectangles filled with random colours.

The code is a bit messy and roughly works as follows.

1. makeGrid1() draws rectangles in the form of a grid filled with different random colours (chosen from a fixed palette)

2. render() draws concentric noisy circles over this grid.

3. render() first calls cpolygon() which is a function to draw concentric polygons.

4. cpolygon() calls mpolygon() which is a function to draw each noisy circle.To make the circle appear hand drawn mpolygon() calls polygon() function

5. polygon() function draws the noisy circle.The circle is drawn with same radius on each call but noise levels are different on each call to the function.To change the noise on each call, time based simplex noise is used as below.

    ```
    let t = millis()/1000;
    // change noise .05 to .1,.2,.01 etc
    let rn = simplexNoise.noise4D(.05*x,0.05*sy,r*cos(2*PI*t),r*sin(2*PI*t));
    ```

      Since t changes on each call the noise also changes.

6. Finally makegrid() is called to draw the borders for the original rectangles drawn in makegrid1().This breaks the circles rendered making them appear like they have been drawn as hatches for each rectangle.
