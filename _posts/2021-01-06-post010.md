#### PROBLEM

[Problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=151)

A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.

Every Monday morning, the supervisor opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper with size A1.

The supervisor proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then one of the sheets is cut in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until an A5-size sheet is obtained, which is needed for the first batch of the week.

All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.

<img src = "/images/e010.png" width = "150"/>  

At the beginning of each subsequent batch, the supervisor takes from the envelope one sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, then it is used. If it is larger, then the 'cut-in-half' procedure is repeated until an A5-size sheet is obtained, and any remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.

Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number of times (during each week) that the supervisor finds a single sheet of paper in the envelope.

Give your answer rounded to six decimal places using the format x.xxxxxx .

--------

We represent the envelope as a list a

a[0] represents number of A1 sheets

a[1] represents number of A2 sheets

.

.

a[4] represents number of A5 sheets

Initially we have a = [1,0,0,0,0]

In the beginning of week 1 , we have only once choice - cut the first A1 sheet.

Once this is done we have

a = [0,1,1,1,1]

Note that although we get 2 A5 sheets, one gets used.

Now we have a choice of picking A2,A3,A4,A5
Let's say we pick A2 , once done with the cutting we will have

a = [0,0,2,2,2]

So went from [1,0,0,0,0] --> [0,1,1,1,1] --> [0,0,2,2,2]

Again, we have a choice of picking A3,A4 or A5, if we pick A3 we end up with

a = [0,0,1,3,3]

It's easy to see we will end up with many possible paths.

Recursive solution seems like a good bet.

Below is a partial Python snippet showing how this can be done.

```
def f(x,b):

    # intially number of times
    # the supervisor finds a single sheet of paper in the envelope.
    # is 0
    ans = 0
    # if all sheets add up to 1
    # ans increase by 1
    if sum(x) == 1:
        ans += 1
    # we done with the last batch
    if b == 0:
        return ans
    # pick a sheet
    for i in range(5):
        if x[i] != 0:
            # probability of picking this sheet
            p = x[i]/sum(x)
            # update expected value of finding a single sheet
            ans += p*f(cutsheet(x,i),b-1)

    return ans


```

cutsheet is a function that updates the number of sheets once we are done with cutting and b is the number of batches.
