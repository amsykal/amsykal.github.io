>Piet Mondrian: 'Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality. To approach the spiritual in art, one will make as little use as possible of reality, because reality is opposed to the spiritual. We find ourselves in the presence of an abstract art. Art should be above reality, otherwise it would have no value for man.'

**CODE FOR THIS SERIES OF SKETCHES**
<hr>
```
// basic rectangle division
// repeated division of rectangle into smaller rectangles
// this sketch has code for simple division

// smallest permitted width or height
// change s for variations
let s = 15;
// margin (border)
let margin = 10;
// to store palette
let colors = [];


function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
  background(255)
  colors = [color(208, 0, 0),color(255, 186, 8),
            color(221, 225, 230),color(63, 136, 197),
            color(0,0,0)];
}

function draw(){
  noLoop();
  // call recursive div algorithm
  drawRect(margin,margin,width-2*margin,height-2*margin);
}

// recursive division of rectangle
function drawRect(x,y,w,h)
{
  // draw a rectangle of width w and height h at (x,y)
  render(x,y,w,h);

  // then figure out if we need to draw another
  let splitWidth = random(1) > 0.5;
  let splitWhere = random(0.3, 0.8);

  // if we're splitting the width
  if(splitWidth && w > s)
  {
    drawRect(x, y, w * splitWhere, h);
    drawRect(x + (w * splitWhere), y, w * (1 - splitWhere), h);
  }
  // else if we're splitting the height
  else if(h > s)
  {
    drawRect(x, y, w, h * splitWhere);
    drawRect(x, y + (h * splitWhere), w, h * (1 - splitWhere));
  }
}

// final sketch to draw rectangles
function render(x,y,w,h){
  push();
  // move center to x,y i.e make current rectangle the reference
  translate(x,y);
  // colors etc
  let fl = random(colors);
  fill(fl);
  stroke(0);
  // change depending on size of rectangle, greater thickness for larger rects
  strokeWeight(1);
  rect(0,0, w, h);
  pop();
}
```

This is a simple series of sketches.

We draw rectangles recursively,deciding at every iteration of the recursion whether to divide vertically or horizontally.

Variations are the result of randomisation of division,changes in size of smallest possible rectangle and choice of colours.

Th choice of color palette in this  series is influenced in part by Piet Mondrian's Composition II with Red, Blue and Yellow.
