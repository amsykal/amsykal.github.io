This series uses Open Simplex Noise to draw lines.

The idea is to first make a grid of cells.The function makegrid() handles this bit. And for each cell makegrid() calls render().
render() then fills each cell with horizontal lines.
The lines are drawn using 2D Open Simplex Noise as so

```
// drawing the lines
for(let i = m; i <= s-m; i+=g){

  beginShape();
  for(let x = m; x <= s-m; x+=g){
    // try changing k to .01 to 0.001,0.1 etc
    // change sc to 1,5,10,etc
    let sc = 15;
    let k = 0.05
    let y = i+sc*simplexNoise.noise2D(seed+k*x,seed+k*i);
    vertex(x,y);
  }
  endShape();
}
```

We run 2 loops one to move down the vertical axis(i) and one to move along the horizontal axis(x)

If we were to change vertex(x,y) to vertex(x,i) we would simply get evenly spaced straight horizontal lines. What we do with the simplex noise is to shift i by just a bit at each point.This particular implementation uses the 2D version which takes 2 inputs.

```
let y = i+sc*simplexNoise.noise2D(seed+k*x,seed+k*i);
```
i and x are the original points in this particular cell.
Note that we shift the origin to each top left corner of cell and render() draws wrt this shifted origin. 

k decides smoothness of the line.Smaller the value smoother the line, higher the value, jerkier the line.

sc is just a scaling factor.

seed - simplex noise is pseudo random in nature, i.e for a given set of input values , it always returns the same value.
In order to have different lines in different cells we change the seed value.If we do not change seed, every cell will have similar looking lines.

Perlin noise will work just fine for this series.

Etienne Jacob offers a gentle and more thorough look at the ways in which we can use noise [here](https://necessarydisorder.wordpress.com/2017/11/15/drawing-from-noise-and-then-making-animated-loopy-gifs-from-there/)

Code has comments on where randomness has been implemented to generate the variations.
