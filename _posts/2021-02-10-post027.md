This series presents an attempt at Moire Patterns.

From [Wolfram Mathworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoirePattern.html)

'A Moiré pattern is an interference pattern produced by overlaying similar but slightly offset templates. A simple example is obtained by taking two identical ruled transparent sheets of plastic, superposing them, and rotating one about its center as the other is held fixed. '

1. makegrid() divides the canvas into smaller rectangles(cells).
2. Each cell calls render() twice
3. render() draws noise based lines with end points located on a circle. The inclination of the lines changes from one cell to next and the angle by which it shifts is also controlled by noise.
4. The second call to render() does the same except in background colour and rotated by a certain angle wrt the first render()
